# TheWeekndSite
I made a site about TheWeeknd (Abel Makkonen Tesfaye) as a passion project

This was made using html, css and javascript.

I used Firebase as reatime database to store the individual album ratings. The user can choose to reset rating (if they happen to make a mistake in the rating) by clicking the "RESET RATING" button, the site won't allow the user to rate again otherwise, once rated.

For hosting the site I used Firebase as well and I am using a custom domain
